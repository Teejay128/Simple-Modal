                <p>It's been 10 years since we last crossed paths, and I am proud to let you know that I am now a certified agbero</p>
                <p>What a journey it was, starting from my first street harassment to now that I lead my own cult</p>
                <p>There were a lot of obstacles like rival cults, police officers and other touts, but I thank Satuala my goddess for showing me the least troublesome routes to pass, and for following me to confront other cults</p>
                <p>I would like to tell you more about this journey but, as you are past me you are still going to meet it along the way</p>
